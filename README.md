# WebScraper
The code parses this [website](https://www.nature.com/nature/articles) and takes the number of pages and the type of article we want to view as input arguments, then saves all the articles in the directory of the page number it is scraping. If there are N inputs of pages then there will be `page_N` directories. All the articles are saved as`.txt` file.
